# ConcurrencyRunner

Small demo project showing a driver for running concurrent actions in Python and my attempts to re-create it in C++.

Props to the following article for explaining setting up linking properly for visual studio: https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/windows/msvc2019/index.php

I'll finish this project at a later date, but it was a fun learning experience.
